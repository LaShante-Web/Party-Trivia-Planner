# Party-Planner-and-Random-Trivia


This project is about planning a party for baby showers, gender reveals, weddings, birthday parties, shopping, and everyday todo lists. You can use this web application to create list items. A visitor could create a title for planning and add and remove information from the planning list. In addition, a vistor could come to this web application to generate random trivia. One could provided feedback about the web application. This web application is for interactivity.

I created an array to display photos and information pertaining to weddings, baby showers, and birthdays. This project displays random food trivia from Spoonacular.com with fetch API. I used an API key to retrieve data from external API. I created a form with a name email, and textarea input. I used a regex to make sure the email contains an @ symbol. After the vistor hits the submit button the information is posted to an external API on formcarry.com. You would need to sign in, go to myforms and click on Code Louisville to see submission results. I created function with multiple parameters to display a paragram on the web application.
